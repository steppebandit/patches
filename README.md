## Splinters of Humanity

> Trait: Prankster
>
> Will hatch devious plans or pranks to play on other unsuspecting victims, often for his own amusement.
> 
> Ever since Joseph was a small child his preffered method of comunicating with people would be to surprise them in some way, or to prank them in some way if they did him any harm. 
> 
> When he was a child, one of Joseph's revenge pranks was to have a kettle of hot water fall over another one his peers. In adulthood, one of the last pranks that got Joseph into trouble was when he decided to trip over another kettle over the head of the high priest of the Order of the White. 
> 
> Unbeknownst to him and to the Order, the kettle was filled with cursed water, a substance that would immediately turn anyone it touched into brittle stone.
>
> This unfortunate event is what led Joseph into being banished, and the entire ordeal was covered up by the Order.

> Trait : Forlorn
>
> Joseph was abandoned by his close relatives and loved ones after failing to become a knight, and he carries the echo of his failure everywhere around him

## Creed

> ~~#### Disdain for the holy clergy
> Due to his failed attempts at entering into the order of the holy knights of Carim/Peregric/Astora, Joseph carries a deep resentment for any order of knights that seem to have any semblance of holiness attached to him, and he is more than happy to play insidious pranks on them~~
> #### Pranking
> Joseph loves his own humour more than anything else, so he indulges in it with every chance he gets. He often tries to tell a sad joke that nobody understands in front of others, or, when wronged, will atempt to enact a a more sinister prank that often makes unfortunate victims.

- What kingdom/state/city do you dwell from? What are some important aspects
regarding it? (You may cooperate as players and come from the same land.) 
- What and who were you before becoming undead?

> Joseph used to be one of the many aspiring squired wanting to become a knight for the gods, however, due to him playing pranks on his fellow knights and squires, he was disgraged and banished to other places in the land. After his banishment, he decided to try his hand at the one thing he always enjoyed doing, playing sad pranks on other folks, with the occasional mercenary work. He now comes from the land of Fallen Astora, where he is a contract Jester.

- What was the reaction of your close ones when the dark sign showed?
- What is the thing you grieve the most for leaving behind?

> Joseph's loved ones already abandoned him when he was declared unfit for the order, and him becoming undead is only divine retribution for his silly deeds. Joseph misses his fellow squires and mentor knights, but above all, he misses the respect he had when his life was prim and proper. However, Joseph still believes that the divine still has a role for him to play. In his own words : "God gives his silliest battles, to his funniest clowns."
> After he was a mercenary jester, he was found in Fallen Astora by the clerics of the Way of the White, and he was taken by force to the Forrest of Rememberance.

- What do you fear forgetting the most about your life?
- What is something you desperately want to forget, but it keeps coming back?

> Joseph would like to forget that he was a knight, even if he knows that leaving his past self behind can only mean further wrath from the Divine. At the same time, the only things keeping him entertained are his devious pranks that he uses to entertain himself.
