when he and the Flame started losing power, only 4 of the gods offered their aid, becoming fellow Lords
Ivedea, goddess of fickle love, gave him her eyes, now becoming Ivedea, the Blind Lover; the adoration of her followers became even more ardent
wandering god Pigmmer, the one whose journey painted the land with rivers, gave his feet, becoming Pigmmer, the Brushed (now painting the land with his blood instead)
Nevetendre, tender of flames, gave one of his arms, becoming Autocrat Nevetendre; in doing so, his inner flame burst out, carbonizing all the people of city; nature overgrew the remains
Crossbred Sikhelle, half-dragon half-giant goddess of buildings and culture, gave her only wing, still keeping her name; she became associated with theft and pillaging, and worship of her became taboo outside of _Map
